If just like me, you want to:
- Avoid Giving your email to every single website with a good blog just to receive alerts about "new articles"
- To avoid forgetting about this mail because you just put it as "read"
- Read some good blog articles that you chose

Then this is for you (if you are curious or just a developer)

You need to make some configurations, yeah, I know, it sucks, working on it to make it smoother (probably community based, if we ever get a community on that amazing piece of code).
