If just like me, you want to:
- Avoid Giving your email to every single website with a good blog just to receive alerts about "new articles"
- To avoid forgetting about this mail because you just put it as "read"
- Read some good blog articles that you chose

Then this is for you (if you are curious or just a developer)

Blog-scrap is a simple website (WIP) that uses github actions under the hood to scrap your favorite blogs and get all the articles back in just one place, how amazing is that?

You just need to make some configurations, in order to get the article metadatas from the blog you are scrapping (yeah, I know, it sucks, working on it to make it smoother, probably community based, if we ever get a community on that amazing piece of code).

(Also, I am aware that RSS exists, but guess what, not all the blogs have it... And I am just tired of opening 50 tabs everytime to check if something new came out.)
